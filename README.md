# 🎬 Movie List App

Welcome to my **first full-stack web development project** — the **Movie List App**!  
This simple yet dynamic PHP-based CRUD application allows users to **add, view, edit, and delete movies** using a clean, minimal UI.

> ✅ This is my **first project with backend integration**, and I learned a lot while building it — from setting up a local server to working with SQL, PHP, and version control using GitHub.
