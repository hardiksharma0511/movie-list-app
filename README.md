# 🎬 Movie List App

Welcome to my **first full-stack project with backend integration** — a simple, clean PHP-based Movie List App!  
This CRUD application lets you **add, view, edit, and delete** movie records using a MySQL database.

> ✨ I built this project while learning PHP & MySQL and used XAMPP for the backend. Through this, I gained hands-on experience with backend development, database integration, and full-stack deployment locally.
