# 🎬 Movie List App

Welcome to my **first full-stack project with backend integration** — a simple **PHP-based Movie List App**! This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to **add, view, edit, and delete** movies in a MySQL database. It’s built with **PHP** for the backend, **MySQL** for the database, and a simple **HTML/CSS** frontend.

> ✨ **Project Journey**  
> This project marks my first foray into backend development. I used **XAMPP** to set up a local server for PHP and MySQL, giving me hands-on experience with database integration and backend logic. I've learned how to interact with MySQL databases, handle user input with PHP, and deploy a local web application.
